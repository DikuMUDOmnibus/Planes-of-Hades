0 POH Planes of Hades~
			Greetings

This code is based on Planes of Hades codebase which is based on Low codebase which then is based on Godwars.

POH was modifed by Aronacus, Delleb, Vendetta, Stryfe, Gabrielle and Blasphemy.

This group basically debugged, implemented alot of new stuff that you won't see in LOW code. Also had alot of fun doing it.
   This code is given to (your name here) and to be used  as the basis for hopefully the next generation of White wolf based games.

Also see Help LOW

LOW was created by Sage and his group. Additional Modifications were done by Phantom. These guys laid the ground work for POH to have been created.
